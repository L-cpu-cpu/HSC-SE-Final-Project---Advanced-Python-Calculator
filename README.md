# HSC-SE-Final-Project---Advanced-Python-Calculator

# About this program:
This Python-powered calculator aims to incorporate as much functionality as possible from a scientific calculator into a Progressive Web Application (PWA).

This PWA is done for the Year 12 HSC Software Engineering final project

# Features:
- A calculation that allows for the input of equations
- A formula mode that has equations for areas, trigonometry, quadratics and physics
- A regression mode that allows users to input x and y values to calculate a linear regression equation for it
- Ability to save results to a permanent database or a session-only variable
- Ability to use database results and variables in equations
- Ability to change the rounding value in the settings
- View saved results, sort by keyword or value, search for a specific result and remove them if necessary

# Dependencies:
This program requires the following libraries installed with a virtual environment created and activated:
- math
- matplotlib
- pandas
- numpy
- flask (Flask, request, session, url_for, render_template)
- flask_wtf (CSRFProtect)
- flask_csp (flask_csp)
